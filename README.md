# Ah yes zsh

Just zsh that i use in my main laptop (Arch Linux), So please do not ask anything...

Also! Thanks [@stel-bl](https://github.com/stel-bl) For the idea and this fork too <3

# VERY NOTICE!!!!

Icons will be always broken, please install nerd-fonts ```sudo pacman -S nerd-fonts --noconfirm``` to your devices, and change to any nerd fonts in terminal settings (If youd don't know how to, please use google), If you use in server, install in client, if you use windows and want to use this, windows terminal is kinda bad idea for this and i had no idea for this...
